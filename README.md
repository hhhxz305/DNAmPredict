# DNAmPredict

This repository holds the R scripts used for the paper "Predicting DNA Methylation from Genetic Data Lacking Racial Diversity Using Shared Classified Random Effects". 
Each R script was named by corresponding analysis procedure, followed by a number suggesting the step. 
For example, Import_setupdata.0.R indicates this is step 0 and in this code we demonstrated how to import the data and set up the data ready to use for the next step.
